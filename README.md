I've created a CTF (Capture The Flag) solver toolkit with various utilities commonly needed in cybersecurity competitions. The application includes:
```
1. **Cryptography Tools**:

1. Caesar cipher encryption/decryption with adjustable shift
2. Vigen√®re cipher encryption/decryption



2. **Encoding Tools**:

1. Base64 encoding/decoding
2. Hex encoding/decoding
3. URL encoding/decoding



3. **Forensics Tools**:

1. File information analysis
2. Hex dump viewer
3. String extraction utility



4. **Web Tools**:

1. HTTP request builder with custom headers and methods
2. Response analyzer





The interface is organized with tabs for easy navigation between different tool categories. Each tool provides appropriate inputs and outputs for the specific operation. The application also includes a dark/light mode toggle for better visibility in different environments.

You can use this toolkit to help solve common CTF challenges by quickly applying various transformations and analysis techniques to the challenge data.
